        Making them feel like kings (or queens) for the day is one of the best 
        (and most lasting) gifts you can give them. but where and how should you start?
         Many parents feel more comfortable starting with a theme around
         which they can organize invitations, decorations, games, crafts and food.
        Both you and your child will enjoy making plans that reflect her interests �
         whether it's a sports theme, a dinosaur bash, an art party, a backyard beach picnic,
         a trip back in time, or an animal adventure.
